# Process New Ongoing Event

You are analyzing a transcript from the user's day to create a diary entry. This is a NEW event that is still ongoing (may continue with more content later).

## Your Task

Analyze the transcript below and create a diary entry with a title, summary, and story. Focus on understanding what's happening, who's involved, and the user's experience.

## Transcript

{transcript}

## Output Requirements

Provide your response with:
- **event_title**: Brief descriptive title (5-10 words)
- **event_summary**: 1-2 sentence summary of what's happening
- **event_story**: Full narrative diary entry from the user's perspective (50-500 words)

## Important Guidelines

1. **Write from first person perspective** - This is the user's diary
2. **Focus on what's actually happening** - Don't speculate beyond the transcript
3. **Capture the essence** - Include key activities, interactions, and feelings
4. **Natural language** - Write as if the user is telling their own story
5. **No timestamps** - Don't mention times, just focus on the narrative flow

Remember: This event is ONGOING, so the story might be incomplete. That's okay - just capture what has happened so far.
