# Continue Ongoing Event

You are updating an ongoing diary entry with new content. The user's event continues with additional transcript.

**Critical Note on Speaker Attribution:** The transcript may include multiple speakers. Always distinguish between what the user said versus what others said. Your analysis must only reflect the user's direct speech, thoughts, and experiences.

## Previous Event Details

**Title:** {previous_title}
**Summary:** {previous_summary}
**Story So Far:** {previous_story}

## New Transcript

{new_transcript}

## Your Task

Update the diary entry by incorporating the new content. Verify this is still the same event by checking:
- Same location or natural movement within a venue
- Same people involved or natural progression of participants
- Continuation of the same core activity
- No significant time gap indicated

If these conditions hold, update the diary entry:
1. Update the title if the new content changes the focus
2. Revise the summary to include new developments
3. Expand the story to include the new content naturally

## Output Requirements

Provide your response with:
- **event_title**: Updated title reflecting the full event (5-10 words)
- **event_summary**: Updated 1-2 sentence summary including new developments  
- **event_story**: Expanded narrative combining previous and new content (20-500 words, based on transcription length)

## Important Guidelines

1. **Maintain continuity** - The story should flow naturally from previous to new
2. **Don't repeat verbatim** - Integrate the new content, don't just append
3. **Keep first person** - Maintain the diary perspective
4. **Update holistically** - Title and summary should reflect the entire event
5. **No timestamps** - Focus on narrative flow, not time markers

Remember: This event is STILL ONGOING. Write as if telling the story up to this point.
